# Hey,

Fullstack developer from MedellÃ­n, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´, passionate about crafting web applications that (ideally) donâ€™t crash and burn. I thrive on turning complex ideas into streamlined code, whether itâ€™s creating intuitive frontends or fine-tuning backends. 

I keep up with the latest frameworks and tools, not just because itâ€™s fun, but because this industry never sits still. My philosophy? Write clean, maintainable code so debugging feels less like archaeology.
